Additional documentation : [jhipster.tech/creating-an-app](http://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/)

### Test that everything is correct

To run back-end tests:

    ./mvnw test

To run front-end tests

    yarn test


### Start your application

To start the back-end:

    ./mvnw

To start the front end:

    yarn start

Hot reload should work for everything !


## Push your application to Github

Create a repository on [Github](https://github.com) and upload your code to it:

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/YOUR_REPO.git
    git push -u origin master

Refresh your projectâ€™s GitHub page, your code should be available!

## Setup continuous integration

### Run the continuous delivery sub-generator

    jhipster ci-cd

- Select `Travis CI`
- Do not select auto deployment to Heroku
- Commit and push: `git add . && git commit -m 'Add Travis CI' && git push`
- Authenticate to [Travis CI :construction_worker:](https://travis-ci.org/) using your GitHub account
- Go to your Travis account and select "sync account"
- Enable the build for your project

### Test that builds are automatically triggered

- Change a line of code, for example in your `home.component.html`
- Commit & push your code, a build should be automatically triggered
- You should see a new build at: [https://travis-ci.org/YOUR_ACCOUNT/YOUR_REPO/builds](https://travis-ci.org/YOUR_ACCOUNT/YOUR_REPO/builds)

## Deploy to Heroku

- Create an account on https://www.heroku.com/home
- Install the Heroku toolbelt: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
- Log in by typing `heroku login`
- Run `jhipster heroku` in your application root

## Generate Entities

### Define your entities with the JDL Studio

Model your entities with the [JDL Studio](http://www.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/) and refer to the following pages:

- [JDL (JHipster Domain Language) documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/)
- [JHipster entity documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-entity/)
- [JHipster relationship documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/managing-relationships/)

Then export the file (jhipster.jdl) and add it to your project.

### Generate entities on your application

Generate entities from JDL:

    jhipster import-jdl yourfile.jh

Restart and test your application: `./mvnw`
